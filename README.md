| Pyhton | Creating visualizations that reveal inequalities from annual infection rates in Male and Female data. I decided to review this data to challenge my visualization skills. I intend to make further commits along my journey data science journey. Please feel free to review and critique |

1. Cleaning the data involved identifying the data types, filling in all Null values with the mean of their respective collumns
2. Next I then decided to run value counts on the numerical columns I would need for my visualization
3. Once that process was completed ran a heatmap to view my column correlations
4. In the next step I creeated variables based off the heatmap created earlier to view different variations of column averages
5. Using these average variables I then created multi variable plots with the matplot library to further explain the averages
6. Lastly I created an explanatory visualization to compare the annual average data between males and females
